# Route 53

- can register domain names
  - can also use dns from other registrars
- dns service
  - can route to s3 buckets, ec2 instances, elb
- health checking of endpoints
- automatic failover
- traffic flow
- integrates with other services
- routing policy
  - simple
    - for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain
    - e.g. web server that serves content from some domain
  - failover
    - when you want to configure active-passive failover
    - one active app, and a standby one to be routed traffic to when the active one fails
  - geolocation
    - when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users
    - lets you balance load by directing requests to specific endpoints based on geographic location from which the request originates
    - allows for customization of localized content
      - presenting the right language
      - restricting distribution of content to only the markets you have licensed
    - 3 levels of granularity
      - continent
      - country
      - state
    - provides a global record for which is served in cases where an end user's location doesn't match any of the specific geo dns record you have created
    - can also combine geo dns with other routing types such as latency based, and failover
  - geoproximity
    - when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and optionally shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another
  - latency
    - when you have resources in multiple regions and you want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency
  - multivalue answer
    - when you want route 53 to respond to dns queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random
  - weighted
    - use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify
    - e.g. 80% to one resource, 5% to another, and the rest to another
- dns resolution updates take time to propagate
  - because it is a global service and need to wait for ttl to expire
  - by default, gotta give it 24h
