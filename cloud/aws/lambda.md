# Lambda

- serverless
- replaces EC2 for the most part
- only pay for the compute time you consume and the storage you allocate to it
- don't even need to worry about VPC's/security groups/NACLs/subnets/etc
- continuous scaling
- integrates with almost all other AWS services
- flexible resource model
- first step is to upload your code
- can run at edge locations
- can participate in savings plans
- natively supports
  - java
  - go
  - powershell
  - node.js
  - c#
  - python
  - ruby
- can support any language through a runtime api
- never do a direct cost between lambda and ec2
  - it doesn't take into account all of the redundancy, scalability, fault tolerance, management, etc that lambda does for you
