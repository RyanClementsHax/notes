# Analytics

- aws analytics
  - many services
  - athena
    - analyze data in S3 using SQL
    - serverless (basically)
    - pay per query
    - no need to set up ETL
    - can be used to query log files stored in s3
    - can be used to generate business reports on data stored in s3
    - analyze aws cost and usage reports
    - run queries on click-stream data
    - can do this over tons of data
    - no data warehouses or clusters to manage
  - EMR (Elastic Map Reduce)
    - hadoop framework
    - need to hook up with auto scaling in order to scale automatically
- macie
  - uses ML and NLP to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in S3
  - dashboards, reporting, and alerts
  - works directly with data stored in S3
  - can also analyze cloud trail logs
  - great for PCI-DCS and preventing id theft
- rekognition
  - video/image analysis
  - i.e. facial recognition
- comprehend
  - NLP service
  - fully managed
- kenesis
  - realtime streaming
  - analytics
    - use sql to process the data from your data stream
  - streams
    - fully managed
    - ingestion service that provides data streams to consumers (e.g. analytic applications)
  - client library
    - process and query streaming
    - used by streams
    - very complex
    - sql interface
  - firehose
    - loading data streams and not creating sql-based applications
    - its more about "pointing" the data to a specific endpoint
      - s3
      - redshift
- quick sight
  - showing results of data analytics on data lakes like redshift
  - imbedable dashboards
- detective
  - persistent machine learning service
  - automatically collates log data from ALL aws services
  - data collected is then applied to ML algorithms to derive data patterns between aws services and resources, grph theory and statistical analysis
- polly
  - turns text into lifelike speech
