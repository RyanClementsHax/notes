# S3

- online bulk storage service that you can almost access from anywhere
- resides outside of your VPC
- built for 4 9's availability
- guaranteed 99.9% availability
- 11 9's durability
- can enable MFA delete
- fundamentals
  - key (name)
  - value (data being stored)
  - version id
  - metadata
  - subresources
    - access control lists
    - torrent
- 0 to 5TB files allowed
- can enable static website hosting
- transfer family supports
  - ftp
  - sftp
  - ftps

## Buckets
- root level folders
- any subfolder is referred to as a folder
- created in regions
- security configured on the bucket level through bucket policies
- names
  - have to be unique across ALL AWS accounts
    - this is because AWS provisions a dns entry for your s3 bucket
  - cannot be formatted as an IP address
  - other restrictions can be found online
- comes with other services like logging, encryption, etc
- can enable static website hosting
- just because you make the bucket public doesn't mean you make the objects in it public
- on successful upload, you get a `200`
- encryption
  - in transit
    - only encrypted when object in transfer
    - SSL/TLS
  - at rest
    - encrypted on the hard drive
    - server side
      - SSE-S3 (Server Side Encryption - S3)
        - amazon manages the keys in s3
        - cannot get details on who/when encrypts/decrypts
      - SSE-KMS (Server Side Encryption - AWS Key Management Service)
        - you manage the keys using KMS
        - you can get details on who/when encrypts/decrypts
        - uses AES-256
      - SSE-C (Server Side Encryption With Customer Provided Keys)
    - client side
      - encrypt object then upload it to S3
  - can enable it on the bucket level or just the object level
- versioning
  - default disabled
  - this is at bucket level
  - once enabled, cannot disable, can only suspend
  - if you make one version public, it doesn't mean that all other versions become public
  - can delete individual versions
  - can put delete marker on newest version of the object (all objects are still stored though)
  - can enable MFA delete
- object lock
  - WORM model (write once, read many)
  - governance mode
    - users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions
  - compliance mode
    - a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user including root user
  - legal hold
    - prevents an object version from being overwritten
    - like a retention period
    - has no associated retention period and remains in effect until removed
    - can be freely placed and removed by any user who has the proper permission
  - can be applied to an object or a whole bucket
- glacier vault lock
  - easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual s3 glacier vaults with a vault lock policy
  - once locked, the policy can no longer be changed
  - specify control  like WORM policy
- logging
  - can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket
  - this can be sent to another bucket and even another bucket in another account

## Consistency
- read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
  - if you upload a file to S3, you are able to read it immedately
- eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
  - takes time to propagate

## Storage classes
- the "classification" assigned to each object in S3
- standard
  - default
  - most expensive
  - 4 9's availability
  - did I hear 11 9's of durability?
  - designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently
- standard-IA
  - infrequent access
  - for data accessed not as often but requires rapid access when you need it
  - minimum storage duration requirement
  - lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retreival fee
- one zone-IA
  - infrequent access
  - only available in one availability zone
  - lower cost option for data not accessed often
  - lowest accessibility rating
- reduced redundancy
  - frequently access, non-critical
  - being phased out
- intelligent-tiering
  - monitors access patterns to automatically determine IA or standard
  - uses ml to figure out what's best for you
- glacier
  - data archiving
  - super cheap
  - retrieval time is configurable from minutes to hours
  - encrypted in glacier
  - data retreival
    - standard: 3-5h
    - bulk: 5-12h
    - expedited: 1-5min
  - can only transfer files into glacier via CLI or API, not in console
- glacier deep archive
  - lowest cost storage
  - 12 hour retrieval time

## Performance
- prefix
  - think of it like a folder
- can get better performance by spreading your reads across different prefixes
  - reading is capped per prefix
- encryption
  - adding encryption puts means you will hit KMS limits
  - hard limits and region specific
- multipart uploads
  - recommended for files over 100MB
  - required for files over 5GB
  - parallelize uploads
- byte range fetches
  - parallel downloads
  - if failure in download, only failure in that byte range
  - can be used to just download partial files

## S3 Select
- enables applications to retrieve only a subset of data from an object by using simple SQL expressions
- can be MAJORLY faster and cheaper
- glacier select similar to this

## Sharing across accounts
- using bucket policies and IAM (applies across the entire bucket)
  - programmatic access only
- using bucket ACLs and IAM (individual objects)
  - programmatic access only
- cross-account iam roles
  - programmatic and console access

## Cross region replication
- need
  - need source bucket owner to enable source and destination regions enabled for their account
  - must have versioning enabled in both source destination buckets
  - also need iam permissions to be set up
    - we are after all moving data between regions
- can specify multiple destination buckets
- can change storage class of replicated objects
- creating a rule won't automatically apply it to all existing items
  - just new ones created
- when a new object version is uploaded, the replication only happens to that new version, not the ones that happened before it
- if you change the permissions of an object in one bucket or the bucket itself, it doesn't change it in the other bucket
- can do this across accounts
- delete markets aren't replicated by default
- deleting individual versions or delete markets won't be replicated
- two types
  - sync
  - async
- good for
  - latency issues
  - compliance
  - operational efficiency
  - data replication

## Transfer acceleration
- uses cloudfront edge network to accelerate uploads
- instead of uploading directly to s3, you can use distinct url to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer that file to s3
- there is an online tool to help

## DataSync
- fully managed with a built-in retry mechanism
- allows you to move a large amount of data to aws
- automatic data integrity checks in transit and at rest
- automatically encrypts data and accelerates transfer over the WAN
- used with NFS and SMB compatible file systems
- replication can be done hourly, daily, or weekly
- install DataSync agent to start replication
- can be used to replicated EFS to EFS
- can use over direct connect or internet links
- one time data migrations, recurring data processing workflows, and automated replication for data protection and recovery
- only pay for the data you copy
- can put it into efs or s3

## Policies
- [S3 bucket action doesn't apply to any resources](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44228422/s3-bucket-action-doesnt-apply-to-any-resources)
  ```json
  {
    "Id": "Policy1495981680273",
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "Stmt1495981517155",
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::surplace-audio",
        "Principal": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  - missing a `/*` or other specifier for `Resource`: `"arn:aws:s3:::surplace-audio/*"`

## ACL (Access Control List)
- where you can manage permissions on an object level

## Lifecycle rules
- allows to configure moving objects to different storage classes over time
- you are charged for these

## Storage gateway
- allows you to integrate existing applications to use cloud storage features
- file gateway
- volume gateway
  - point-in-time snapshots
  - essentially storing hard disc drives
  - stored volume: real thing kept on prem and backed up in cloud
  - cached volume: real think kept in cloud and most frequently accessed data cached on prem
- tape gateway
  - virtual tape library

## Billing
- storage
  - the more you store, the less you pay per GB
- requests
- storage management pricing
- data transfer pricing
- transfer acceleration
  - uses amazon backbone network to speed up file transfers
- cross region replication pricing
