# S3

- online bulk storage service that you can almost access from anywhere
- resides outside of your VPC
- built for 4 9's availability
- guaranteed 99.9% availability
- 11 9's durability
- can enable MFA delete
- fundamentals
  - key (name)
  - value (data being stored)
  - version id
  - metadata
  - subresources
    - access control lists
    - torrent

## Buckets
- root level folders
- any subfolder is referred to as a folder
- created in regions
- names
  - have to be unique across ALL AWS accounts
    - this is because AWS provisions a dns entry for your s3 bucket
  - cannot be formatted as an IP address
  - other restrictions can be found online
- comes with other services like logging, encryption, etc
- can enable versioning
- can enable static website hosting
- just because you make the bucket public doesn't mean you make the objects in it public
- on successful upload, you get a `200`

## Consistency
- read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
  - if you upload a file to S3, you are able to read it immedately
- eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
  - takes time to propagate

## Storage classes
- the "classification" assigned to each object in S3
- standard
  - default
  - most expensive
  - 4 9's availability
  - did I hear 11 9's of durability?
  - designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently
- standard-IA
  - infrequent access
  - for data accessed not as often but requires rapid access when you need it
  - minimum storage duration requirement
  - lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retreival fee
- one zone-IA
  - infrequent access
  - only available in one availability zone
  - lower cost option for data not accessed often
- reduced redundancy
  - frequently access, non-critical
  - being phased out
- intelligent-tiering
  - monitors access patterns to automatically determine IA or standard
  - uses ml to figure out what's best for you
- glacier
  - data archiving
  - super cheap
  - retrieval time is configurable from minutes to hours
- glacier deep archive
  - lowest cost storage
  - 12 hour retrieval time

## ACL (Access Control List)
- where you can manage permissions

## Lifecycle rules
- allows to configure moving objects to different storage classes over time

## Storage gateway
- allows you to integrate existing applications to use cloud storage features
- file gateway
- volume gateway
  - stored volume: real thing kept on prem and backed up in cloud
  - cached volume: real think kept in cloud and cached on prem
- tape gateway

## Billing
- storage
- requests
- storage management pricing
- data transfer pricing
- transfer acceleration
  - uses amazon backbone network to speed up file transfers
- cross region replication pricing
