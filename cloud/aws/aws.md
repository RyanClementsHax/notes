# AWS

- [hands on tutorials](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/)
- create an account with your work email to help establish account ownership if things go wrong
- not all services available in all regions
- quotas
  - all services have default limits
  - aws needs to do capacity planning
  - helps prevent you from fat fingering spinning up more instances than you wanted
- support center
  - account and billing support
  - service limit increase
    - some limits are hard like s3 object size limits
  - technical support
- resource tags
  - can add to lots of stuff that helps with classification, identification, etc
- storage devices
  - when decommissioned, they are destroyed in accordance with industry-standard practices

## Regions
- distinct geographic area
- made up of 2 or more availability zones
- set up services in multiple regions for disaster recovery

### Availability zones
- identified by the region prefix with an alphabetic character at the end (a-z)
  - what is considered 1a for one account might be totally different for another account (its randomized)
- where resources located
- contains one or more datacenters
- availability zones in same region have low latency between each other

## Edge locations
- CDN cache locations
- where Cloud Front stores its data
- tons of these

### Points of presence
- edge places where AWS can replicate data

## Networking
- direct connect
  - ability to connect on-prem servers into the VPC via a VPN
  - without going over the internet
  - scales
  - reduces network costs
  - creates consistent network performance
  - a literal direct connection (no vpns)
  - only supports BGP routing protocol (no static routing protocol)
  - public VIF (virtual interface)
    - needed to access public services like s3
  - private VIF
    - needed to access stuff in a VPC
- you can use vpns to connect to your private cloud
  - typically used to connect on-prem servers to aws services using the internet
- route 53
  - DNS service
- virtual private cloud
- nat gateway
  - provides an egress only access to the internet
  - safe to use for things hosted in private subnets as this only allows egress
  - useful for downloading security patches

## Compute
- EC2
- Lambda

## Storage
- S3
- RDS
- Glacier

## Disaster recovery
- need to understand business objectives

    - RPO / RTO: hours
    - lower priority use cases
    - restore data after event
    - deploy resources after event
    - cost: $
  - pilot light

    - less stringent RTO and RPO
    - core services
    - start and scale resources after
    - cost: $$
  - warm standby
    - RPO / RTO: minutes
    - more stringent RTO and RPO
    - business critial services
    - scale resources after event
    - cost: $$$
