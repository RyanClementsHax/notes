# SCSS

## Loaders
- these will transform the scss into css at build time
- make sure your builders are compatible with any frameworks you are using
  - you can get [esoteric](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66082397/typeerror-this-getoptions-is-not-a-function) errors if your loader version doesn't support your framework version

## [Mixins](https://glennmccomb.com/articles/useful-sass-scss-media-query-mixins-for-bootstrap/)

## Import
- when importing css from scss, don't use the file extension, otherwise you will have problems

## Guidelines
- try not to over nest scss because this will tie it to the dom structure
