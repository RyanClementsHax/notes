# Javascript

## Turn based processing

- this is how many event driven systems like web browsers and UI frameworks are written
- Javascript is single threaded so all threads of execution need to share the same thread using "turns"
- law of turns: Never wait. Never block. Finish fast.
- because turn based processing unwinds the stack after every turn and there are no blocks, exceptions from IO can't be "thrown"
  - this is because the stack trace is list
  - this is a big reason why promises are used

- this just compiles down to higher order components

## [WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)

- not supported by all browsers and CANNOT be polyfilled
- normal maps will hold on to strong references of objects thus preventing them from being garbage collected
- this map holds a weak reference allowing for the map's hold on the object to not be counted towards garbage collection

## Logging

- `console.log` is synchronous so consider using a different logging solution for something in a production app

## Errors

- because you can throw anything in javascript, not everything that can be caught has a stack trace so make sure you wrap whatever you want to throw in an `Error` if it doesn't already have a stack trace
- uncaught errors will crash node
- uncaught promise rejections currently don't crash node, but will eventually in future versions

## [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol)

- `Symbol`s are often used to add unique property keys to an object that wonâ€™t collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to access the object
- every `Symbol()` call is guaranteed to return a unique `Symbol`
- every `Symbol.for("key")` call will always return the same `Symbol` for a given value of `"key"`
- when `Symbol.for("key")` is called, if a `Symbol` with the given key can be found in the global `Symbol` registry, that `Symbol` is returned. otherwise, a new `Symbol` is created, added to the global `Symbol` registry under the given key, and returned.
