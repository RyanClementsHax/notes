# Clean Code

- every line of code in a function should be one level of abstraction below the abstraction level of the function name
- provide enough abstraction in code that you write so that the reader can "bail out early" if they don't care about certain details of implementation
- clean code reads like good prose
- make sure your code is least surprising
