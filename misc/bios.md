# BIOS

## Getting there on Windows
Hit `F2` repeatedly when starting up

## Relation to wifi
There are settings in the BIOS that can enable/disable wifi
    - most are found under the wifi settings section, but some are found in System Configuration
    - these settings can be set in a way that tricks the OS into thinking that a hardware network switch exists on the computer
