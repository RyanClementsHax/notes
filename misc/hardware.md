# Hardware

## BIOS

### Getting there on Windows

Hit `F2` repeatedly when starting up

### Relation to wifi

There are settings in the BIOS that can enable/disable wifi
    - most are found under the wifi settings section, but some are found in System Configuration
    - these settings can be set in a way that tricks the OS into thinking that a hardware network switch exists on the computer

## Ram

- I heard it is possible for ram to cause a blue screen and replacing it should fix it
