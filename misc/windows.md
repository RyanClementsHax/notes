# Windows

## Sharing folders between machines
- first make sure your network settings are open enough to allow the other computer to access it
  - ex: both computers were connected to my wifi so I needed to make sure my computer was discoverable on my private network
- go to the properties of the folder you want to share
- go to the advanced security settings
- click on the share tab
- add the user you want
- make sure to give them the permissions they need
