# Strategies

## Spacing

- this is where you spread out practice sessions to allow a little bit of forgetting to set in
- this is in part why flash cards work well; by the time you restart the deck, you forget what your answers were the last time
- this should also be practiced on a more coarse grained scale (e.g. spread practice over several days instead of massing it on one day)
- a little forgetting is good because it creates the ability to put in the effort needed to make it stick

## Varying

- this is where you expose yourself slight differences in the thing you're trying to learn
- if you want to learn web frameworks, study multiple
- if you want to learn how to make a 3 point shot in basket ball, practice in multiple spots around the hoop

## Interleaving

- this is where you interleave learning multiple disjoint subjects together
- this helps you learn similarities and differences between the subjects better
- instead of studying multiple painters one at a time (blocked practice) interleave the study between them for example

## Generation

- this is where you answer the problem before getting the answer
- this is effective even if the answer you retrieved is wrong, so long as it is corrected

## Elaboration

- this is where you relate what you learned to what you already know

## Reflection

- this is where you go over in your head what you learned and ask yourself questions
- example questions
  - what are they key points?
  - what is new to me?
  - how do they relate to what I already know?
  - how would I define them?
- this is good to do as you are learning something and at the end of your session

## Calibrate

- we are the worst judges for how well we know something
- calibrate how well you know something by finding an objective, external source of verification like a test or a mentor

## Be deliberate

- study in areas that allow you to focus
  - your ability to concentrate is very important
- slow down reading
  - the goal is not for you to finish the books that teach you how to learn, but to actually learn the material they are teaching
