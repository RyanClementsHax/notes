# Chapter 3: Understanding the Domain

## DDD
- DDD translators can become bottlenecks so avoid them
- use a ubiquitous language that everyone abides to
- entities
  - defined by their identity not by their attributes
  - mutable
  - two objects only equal if their unique identifiers equal
- value objects
  - immutable
  - defined by their attributes
- aggregates
  - groupings of entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit
  - ex: a course object that contains lesson plans and a professor
- subdomains
  - a partition of the entire domain
  - the subdomains that are fundamental to an organization are called core domains
    - the reasons the software is worth writing
- bounded contexts
  - conceptual model based on the domain and includes both behaviors and data
  - partitions of the domain model like subdomains are partions of the domain
  - may map to a single domain

## Requirements engineering
- sometimes you need to coerce requirements out of people
- types of requirements
  - business
    - high level business goals of organization
    - often influence the quality attributes of a system
  - functional
    - describe the functionality of the software
    - organizational
      - based on policies and procedures
    - legislative
      - laws
    - ethical
      - ethical operation such as privacy or safety
    - delivery
      - related to delivery or deployment of software
    - standards
    - external
      - integrations with other software
  - non-functional
    - quality attributes that typically end in *ilities*
      - maintainability
      - usability
      - testability
      - interoperability
  - contraints
    - contracts, regulations, etc
- benefits of proper requirements engineering
  - reduced rework
  - fewer unneccessary features
  - lower enhancement costs
  - faster development
  - reduced development costs
  - better communication
  - more accurate system testing estimates
  - higher customer satisfaction levels
- requirements must be measurable and testable
- "Requirements rarely lie on the surface. Normally, they are buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics." - Andrew Hunt and David Thomas in *The Pragmatic Programmer*
