# VS Code

## Omnisharp
- sometimes this doesn't load project properly
- recloning the repo and reopening vscode a few times seems to resolve these issues for me
- this could also be caused by large sln's
  - try making a sln with just what you need
- don't modify code as the server is starting up, this will lead to crazily buggy intellisense
