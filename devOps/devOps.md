# Dev Ops

- must focus on *capability* rather than *maturity*
  - capability focuses on what your company can do and has much more of a continuous learning mindset
  - maturity assumes that there is a set target you need to reach and once you reach there, there is no more improvement to do
- keeping configuration in version control is more highly corellated with performance than keeping application code in version control
- you are more likely to perform poorly as an it department if you have to integrate with external organizations
- external reviews (like those from change approval boards or upper management) negatively impact performance
- you need feedback loops to perform well and also to be able to act on that feedback too
- deployment pain tells a lot about the health of a team and company
- manually configured environments often lead to config drift
