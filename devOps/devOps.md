# Dev Ops

- this is first and foremost a *culture* rather than a set of tools and practices
- must focus on *capability* rather than *maturity*
  - capability focuses on what your company can do and has much more of a continuous learning mindset
  - maturity assumes that there is a set target you need to reach and once you reach there, there is no more improvement to do
- keeping configuration in version control is more highly corellated with performance than keeping application code in version control
- you are more likely to perform poorly as an it department if you have to integrate with external organizations
- external reviews (like those from change approval boards or upper management) negatively impact performance
- you need feedback loops to perform well and also to be able to act on that feedback too
- deployment pain tells a lot about the health of a team and company
- manually configured environments often lead to config drift
- transformational leadership provides the foundation to enact devops principles (due to their need for change and learning to become habit)
- leaders cannot do devops on their own, they need tools and workers to effect those practices though
- if teams choose their own tools, they feel more engaged and are more likely to buy into the new dev ops practices
  - this is not to say that the department can't impose *some* restrictions to prevent technical sprawl or to gain bulk discount benefits
