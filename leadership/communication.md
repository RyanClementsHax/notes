# Communication

- it isn't about what you said, it's about what they heard
- it isn't about what you wrote, it's about what they read
- assume positive intent when talking with someone
  - especially when they are giving critique
- the level of specificity communicates certainty
  - this is why scrum poker uses 20 instead of 21

## Presentations

- when pitching a product/idea to someone or some group, always frame it in a way that interests THEM
  - don't talk about why YOU think the product/idea is great/interesting
  - talk about why THEY should care about the product/idea and what problems it solves for THEM

## Critique

- remember that someoneâ€™s work is their lively hood so critiquing it should be done with care
- seek first to understand
- studies show that people behind bars overwhelmingly don't view themselves as wrong, why do you expect your coworkers to act differently?
- encouragement works better than critique to change someone's behavior
- criticism can make people to strive to justify themselves instead of change the way they think

## Appreciation

- this goes a long way to make people feel good about their work
- extremely powerful motivator

## Advice

- ask people if they want your advice before giving it
- sometimes people just want to be heard or to vent

## Techniques

- personal operating documents
  - these are literally manuals on how a person works
  - you can have all of your team members fill out theirs and share them
  - they can be very useful for a manager

## Consensus

- complete consensus is deceitful
- no high functioning team has complete agreement
- conflict can be healthy
- rather than complete consensus, strive to make everyone heard
  - makes them feel like they had input
  - makes them feel like they have some ownership
