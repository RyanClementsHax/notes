# Decisions

- when leading a project, the people under count on you to be decisive
- good leaders are decisive and know how to operate well in ambiguity
- it sometimes is cheaper to make a decision with less information now then fixing it after rather than spending more time waiting now and potentially getting it right later
- build vs buy
  - it is helpful to build proof of concepts when making this decision

## The JEDI principle

Just Enough Decisions to Implement

- this helps avoid analysis paralysis
- so many times as engineers, we want to design the "perfect" system and are afraid of rework
- we forget or don't realize that getting something out the door is more valuable than avoiding rework
