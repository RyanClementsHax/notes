# Growing a Team

- never let the same person solve the same problem twice
  - this will help spread knowledge
  - also forces documentation/run books/etc to be created

## Pairing

- pair so we can teach people how others do work and when they have to be supported, you can do that in a way that makes them feel confident and safe
