- this helps describe how chaos causes vicious circles of unproductivity and bad relationships
- each persona can rise up to be a better version of themselves using certain techniques

## The feeling of importance

- problems can disappear if people feel important
- angry callers calling customer support can be disarmed if thanked for their complaint and complimented for their keen eye (genuinely of course)

## Trust

- very hard to earn
- easier to earn when you suffer with others
- coin base makes all new engineering managers start by writing code with the team
  - easier to earn trust than to have to earn it over many more months of managing the team

## Tips

- read up on what people are interested in before meeting them; it helps you create good conversation with them and helps make them feel imporant and interesting (plus who doesn't love being nerd sniped)
- get the person to say yes multiple times before stating the point you want them to agree with
- using "and" instead of "but" can help keep criticism positive and well accepted
  - avoid: "You did great in algebra this semester, _but_ your english grade needs more work"
  - do: "You did great in algebra this semester, _and_ if you study more in english you can get that grade up too"
