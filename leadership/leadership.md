# Leadership

## Identifying a future leader
- a good heuristic is to look for the following in people
  - are they grounded?
  - are they growing?
  - are they grateful?
  - are they generous?

## Vision
- the mindset of "how var can I go?" over the mindset of "how long will it take?" can take you much further in life
