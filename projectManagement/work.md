# Work

- IT work can be likened to factory work
  - every work station has workers, methods, measures, and machines
- understand that whenever you make a promise, there are unseen transitive promises that get made from the people you promised to, to the people they promise to

## Prioritization
- need to understand business goals to manage work well
  - they should hit KPIs
- you need to prioritize maintenance work
  - think about what would happen to a freight company if they never spent money on oil changes

## Handling work
- flag work that requires a bottleneck so careful planning can be done to avoid overloading that bottleneck
- levels of escalation can be helpful to protect valuable resources like bottlenecks or experienced developers

## Visualizing work
- allows you to control WIP

## Types of work
- business (external)
  - changes that the business is asking of IT
  - i.e. feature requests
- internal
  - i.e. implementing deployment pipelines
- change work
  - i.e. legal changes
- fire fighting
  - "anti-work"
  - unplanned
  - annoying

## Dealing with bottlenecks
1. identify constraint
2. exploit constraint
3. subordinate constraint
   - setting pace of work according to bottleneck
- all optimizations that aren't improving the bottleneck are pointless
