## GraphQL with Postgres
- [ref](https://netflixtechblog.com/beyond-rest-1b76f7c20ef6)
- Netflix put graphql in their postgress images and autogenerated an api for their db schema essentially circumventing the need for a dedicated api
- allows for rapid development, but has downsides like the ability to DDOS the db by querrying for all rows
