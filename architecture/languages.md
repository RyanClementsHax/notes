## Type systems
- type systems go a long way to reduce the number of checks you have to make to ensure your software works the way you expect
- you get compile time guarantees on a lot of things that you have to defensively code around when choosing a dynamic language
- they can severely reduce the amount of test code you need to write now that you don't need to check types anymore
