# Telemetry

- 4 main types
  - centralized logs
  - metrics
  - traces
  - SEIM (Security Event Information Management)
- evacuate telemetry as fast as possible
  - can't trust ephemeral services and attackers want to change telemetry to hide their tracks
- telemetry should be anonymized to avoid privacy issues
