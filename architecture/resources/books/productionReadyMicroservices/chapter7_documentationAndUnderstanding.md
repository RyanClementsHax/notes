      - should start off with this
      - short, sweet and to the point
    - an architecture diagram
      - the info this provides isn't something you can read in the code
      - illuminates visually points of failure if any
      - abstracts away internal concerns that aren't important
    - contact and on-call info
      - also helpful for people outside of the team to figure out who to contact if they have any questions or concerns
    - links to important info
      - repo
      - architecture diagrams
      - dashboards
    - an onboarding and dev guide
      - the "how to" guide every junior developer wants
    - info about the service's request flow(s), endpoints, and deps
    - an on-call runbook
      - read it so devs can comprehend it at 2AM
    - answers to frequently asked questions
  - it is well understood by the developer team and org levels
  - it is held to a set of production-readiness and meets the associated requirements
  - its architecture is reviewed and audited frequently
- always give an onion
- includes runbooks
- microservice documentation
  - should be centralized, shared, and easily accessed
  - README's and comments are not documentation
  - should be integrated as part of the dev workflow
  - if it is considered a side task, it won't ever get done and get thrown in the pile of tech debt that may never get paid off
  - it should be able to be read by many types of people other than devs like managers, product owners, and execs
  - should not contain too much jargon
- microservice understanding
  - architecture reviews are helpful
    - make sure to bring in people from other teams like dev ops and SRE
  - audits
    - running through the prod-readiness checklist is helpful
