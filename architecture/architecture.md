# Arthitecture

- good principles (as taught by aws)
  - perform operations as code
  - annotate documentation
  - make requent, small, reversible changes
  - refine operations procedures frequently
  - anticipate failure
  - learn from all operational failures
  - see "well architected framework" for more details
- if you can't draw out your architecture, you have problems
- to generate an architecture with properties you want, you start with the properties, then create contstrains in the system that allow for those properties
- great architecture comes out of some smart person having a good idea so your org needs to foster ideation and experimentation
