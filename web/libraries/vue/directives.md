# Directives

## Custom v-if

- [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43003976/a-custom-directive-similar-to-v-if-in-vuejs)
- essentially, you have to do a lot of node modification which may not be desireable
- you could do something like [this](https://github.com/PxyUp/vue-not-visible#readme) too which only replaces and doesn't modify the original node
