# Bootstrap

- Bootstrap has a ton of useful [utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/) that will prevent you from having to write a lot of stuff yourself
- Try to avoid using Bootstrap classes directly. Instead, use a component library. It makes the code look so much nicer

## Scss variables
- can't find any documentation on these, but [here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss) is the github file
- [overwriting bootstrap](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38792005/how-to-change-the-bootstrap-primary-color) requires you to set variables before importing bootstrap
