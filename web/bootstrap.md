# Bootstrap

- Bootstrap has a ton of useful [utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/flex/) that will prevent you from having to write a lot of stuff yourself
- Try to avoid using Bootstrap classes directly. Instead, use a component library. It makes the code look so much nicer
