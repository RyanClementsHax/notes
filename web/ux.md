# UX

- when creating a new project, don't define the boundaries early on
- allow the user to decide what is a problem or too much data, etc

## Forms
- [you should remove many optional fields from your forms](https://uxmovement.com/forms/optional-fields-you-should-remove-on-your-form/)
  - the fewer form inputs you have, the higher the converstion rate
  - if you need extra inputs on start up, you can ask after account creation with a "setup account" ux

## Top vs side nav
- no clear winner
- it depends on what you want your navigation to be
- [this article explains more](https://medium.com/swlh/top-navigation-vs-side-navigation-for-your-interface-3c1f176bc6ae)
- one cool thing to note is that with side navs, all items in view have equal weight to the visitor, but its a left to right priority for the top nav
- [this article provides some objective comparisions](https://uxdesign.cc/top-navigation-vs-side-navigation-wich-one-is-better-24aa5d835643)
- [so does this one](https://uxmovement.com/navigation/top-navigation-vs-left-navigation-which-works-better/#:~:text=A%20top%20navigation%20conserves%20more,left%20column%20of%20your%20page.&text=A%20top%20navigation%2C%20however%2C%20uses,your%20page%20with%20content%20only.)

## Key value ux
- there is surprisingly a lot that goes into this
- lots of ways to implement this
