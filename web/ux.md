# UX

- when creating a new project, don't define the boundaries early on
- allow the user to decide what is a problem or too much data, etc

## Forms
- [you should remove many optional fields from your forms](https://uxmovement.com/forms/optional-fields-you-should-remove-on-your-form/)
  - the fewer form inputs you have, the higher the converstion rate
  - if you need extra inputs on start up, you can ask after account creation with a "setup account" ux
- [be careful with floating labels](https://medium.com/simple-human/floating-labels-are-a-bad-idea-82edb64220f6)

## Top vs side nav
- no clear winner
- it depends on what you want your navigation to be
- [this article explains more](https://medium.com/swlh/top-navigation-vs-side-navigation-for-your-interface-3c1f176bc6ae)
- one cool thing to note is that with side navs, all items in view have equal weight to the visitor, but its a left to right priority for the top nav
- [this article provides some objective comparisions](https://uxdesign.cc/top-navigation-vs-side-navigation-wich-one-is-better-24aa5d835643)
- [so does this one](https://uxmovement.com/navigation/top-navigation-vs-left-navigation-which-works-better/#:~:text=A%20top%20navigation%20conserves%20more,left%20column%20of%20your%20page.&text=A%20top%20navigation%2C%20however%2C%20uses,your%20page%20with%20content%20only.)
- [nielsen chimes in too](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/vertical-nav/)

## [Local navigation](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/local-navigation/?utm_source=Alertbox&utm_campaign=bb7945c7a6-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_11_12_08_52_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_7f29a2b335-bb7945c7a6-40549993)
- this is a separate nav construct apart from the global navigation that helps users navigate the subcategories of the global navigation selected
- this should not be more salient than the global navigation as research shows that users were more likely to think the local navigation options were the only ones that existed (as if the global ones didn't exist)
- there should be minimum interaction cost with this navigation construct

## Breadcrumbs
- [when to use them](https://uxplanet.org/breadcrumbs-for-web-sites-what-when-and-how-9273dacf1960)

## Key value ux
- there is surprisingly a lot that goes into this
- lots of ways to implement this
- [ref](https://design.mindsphere.io/patterns/key-value.html)

## Colors
- don't assume that color meaning is universal
  - e.g. money is red in China
- if you use red in your ui to mean danger, make sure it is consistently meaning danger
- accent colors are good for calls to action

## Skeletons
