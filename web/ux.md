# UX

- when creating a new project, don't define the boundaries early on
- allow the user to decide what is a problem or too much data, etc

## Forms
- [you should remove many optional fields from your forms](https://uxmovement.com/forms/optional-fields-you-should-remove-on-your-form/)
  - the fewer form inputs you have, the higher the converstion rate
  - if you need extra inputs on start up, you can ask after account creation with a "setup account" ux
