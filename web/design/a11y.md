# A11y

- about 20% of people have some visual impairment (even wearing contacts)
- diability means more than physical
  - situational disability: a mother trying to use a website while trying to hold her toddler
- convincing people of the importance of a11y can be summed up by asking "do you want your webpage to be accessible in New York? That's about the amount of people that won't be able to use your application if you don't invest in a11y"
- always implement a11y from the beginning
- applications should handle at least 200% zoom and still function the same
  - if you use responsive design, most of this is taken care of
  - but, if you have logic that provides certain functionality or lack thereof based on screen size, then desktop users who have to zoom in a bunch will end up getting that logic applied to them, potentially creating a bad experience
    - e.g. components that are only interactable via swipe on a small form factor
