# A11y

- about 20% of people have some visual impairment (even wearing contacts)
- diability means more than physical
  - situational disability: a mother trying to use a website while trying to hold her toddler
- convincing people of the importance of a11y can be summed up by asking "do you want your webpage to be accessible in New York? That's about the amount of people that won't be able to use your application if you don't invest in a11y"
- always implement a11y from the beginning
